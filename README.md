# OrionContactsApp
This app was written by Alix Klingenberg as part of an application to the Orion Health mobile team. 

It supports Android 4.0+.

It picks up a list of contacts from [http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users](http://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users) and parses them into Java. It then displays a list of the contacts.  You can drill down into each contact to see more information.
